        <p>Im Christopher Lee I live in New York City and and have grown up their my whole life. My hobbies include playing Videogames, Mahjong and Lion Dance. I tend to have really good beginners luck but it only lasts around a good fifteen minuties. Which is good for gambleing but not much else. I can often be found sketching random items or story boarding</p>
        <p>I actualy was sudying to become an engineer but soon switched to animation buecsae I realised that absolutely for the life of me could not do physics witch is why im better at codeinng that anything else as you will see.
