        <p>I'm Christopher Lee. I live in New York City and have grown up there my whole life. My hobbies include playing Videogames, Mahjong, and Lion Dance. I tend to have good beginner's luck, but it only lasts around fifteen minutes. Which is good for gambling but not much else. I can often be found sketching random items or storyboarding </p>
        <p>I actually was studying to become an engineer but soon switched to animation because I realized that I could not do physics for the life of me, which is why I'm better at coding than anything else, as you will generally see.
